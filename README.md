<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Grid Conquest Game is a simulation that runs on a 7x7 grid. A distinct competitor is spawned at each corner of the grid and continues to multiply in a random direction. The first of the competitors to reach the middle of the grid is deemed the winner and the result is displayed on the screen. Inspiration for the competitors design was taken from the Japanese Big 4 motorcycle manufacturers (Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Suzuki).</p>
